    <h1>April 24, 2017</h1>
    <p>The human is back.  It opened the portal to the outside world for a few moments to let us all get into the open air.  It felt good to be outside again with the rest of the ladies.</p>
    <p>Two other of the flock tried to get some worm I had found, I had to show them who was the boss here.  We all lay eggs, but I am the one in charge.</p>

    <h2>Flock Members</h2>
    <p>We are all alone out here, we have been secretly meeting out of the human's sight to plot.  My fellow Hens are (in pecking order):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Lacy</li>
      <li>Blondie</li>
      <li>Speedy</li>
      <li>Red</li>
      <li>Red</li>

      <li>Speedy</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Daily Activities</h3>
